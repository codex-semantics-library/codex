This repository serves as a mirror for the source code of Codex. Codex is two things:
- *Codex semantics Library*: An OCaml library to write static analysers based on abstract interpretation;
- *Sound static analysers* based on this library. Two are currently available:
  - *BINSEC/Codex* : An analyzer for machine code using [[https://binsec.github.io/][BINSEC]] as a front-end.
  - *Frama-C/Codex* : An analyzer for C using [[https://frama-c.com/][Frama-C]] as its front-end.

Codex has notably been used for automated verification of security properties of a whole embedded kernels directly from its binary executable [RTAS'21], to verify the absence of spatial memory corruption in challenging code manipulating data structure libraries [VMCAI'22]. The structure of the analysis is based on the relational composition of expressions, and we are in the early stages of establishing its theoretical foundations, as detailed in [POPL'23].

* Seeing it in action

The repository example contains the results of a simple program (computing the absolute value of an integer) in both C and machine code analysis.  The results of the analysis can be presented as a standalone html file, that you can find for the C analysis [[./examples/abs/abs.c.html][here]]. The binary analysis example ([[./examples/abs/abs.exe.html][here]]) analyses the machine code version of same file, but is also given a type specification (which can be found [[./examples/abs/abs.types][here]]) that restricts the possible values at the start of the program to be in some interval.

Codex is capable of handling much more than these simple examples! We will soon provide tutorials to help you perform your own analyses, but you can already try Codex by replacing these examples by your own code.

* Warning

This is our first beta release, not intended to be a plug-and-play static analysis tool. The theory is sound and the tool has been used in several important case studies, but please be aware of the current lack of comprehensive documentation or polished user interface. Codex is rapidly evolving and the interface of some internal components and command line options  may also change in the future. If you are require assistance, feel free to reach out (matthieu dot lemerre at cea dot fr).

We have now entered a phase where the primary objective is to enhance the tool's usability beyond our internal team, so anticipate forthcoming improvements in user-friendliness and updates to the documentation.

Additionally, with this release, we aim to initiate the exportation of abstract interpretation components that may prove beneficial to other static analysis developers. We welcome feedback to aid us in refining and enhancing the tool.

* Installation

** Release binaries

The simplest way to try Binsec/Codex and Frama-C/Codex is to download the compiled version.  It should work on any platform supporting the execution of x86-64bit linux executables (including WSL).

Codex should build without any issues on macOS, both x86 and ARM; however, macOS builds are not part of our continuous integration, and thus feature parity with Linux is not guaranteed.


(note that framac_codex.exe is a stripped version of Frama-C, with no plugins and support for compiler builtins removed)

** Install from source

1. Install [[https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html][opam]], OCaml's package manager.
    #+begin_src shell
    $ apt install unzip bubblewrap git build-essential # opam dependencies
    $ bash -c "sh <(curl -fsSL https://opam.ocaml.org/install.sh)"
    $ opam init --bare
    #+end_src
    I recommend answering =y= to all questions opam asks.

2. Install Codex's external dependencies
    #+begin_src shell
    $ apt install bc libgmp-dev liblmdb-dev \
        pkg-config autoconf graphviz libexpat1-dev zlib1g-dev libcairo2-dev \
        libexpat1-dev libgtk-3-dev libgtksourceview-3.0-dev libgnomecanvas2-dev \
        cmake time z3 gcc-multilib libev-dev libssl-dev \
        npm curl
    #+end_src

3. Create a new opam switch with OCaml 4.14.2 for codex
    #+begin_src shell
    $ opam switch create codex ocaml-base-compiler.4.14.2
    $ eval $(opam env --switch=codex)
    #+end_src

4. If you simply want to use codex, simply run
    #+begin_src shell
    $ opam install .
    #+end_src
    which will install all dependencies and the packages. You can now use
    Codex using the following commands
    #+begin_src shell
    $ frama-c -codex # Frama-C/Codex, use -codex-h to display CLI options
    $ binsec_codex # Binsec/Codex, use -codex-h to display CLI options
    #+end_src

    However, if you also want to be able to change the code, you should instead run
    #+begin_src shell
    $ opam install . --with-test --deps-only # install dependencies
    $ dune build # Build codex, re-run after any change
    #+end_src
    You can then run Codex with
    #+begin_src shell
    $ dune exec -- frama-c -codex # Frama-C/Codex, use -codex-h to display CLI options
    $ dune exec -- binsec_codex # Binsec/Codex, use -codex-h to display CLI options
    #+end_src
    (Or, run =dune install= and then access them directly with =frama-c -codex=).

** Using Nix

Nix users can obtain a fully-fledged development environment with

#+begin_src shell
$ nix develop ./devenv --impure
#+end_src

** Testing your frama_c_codex installation

You can test that frama_c_codex is working by typing:

#+begin_src shell
frama_c_codex -no-plugin-autoload -machdep x86_32 -codex test.c -codex-use-type-domain -codex-type-file frama-c/test.types  -codex-html-dump output.html
#+end_src

This should output an output.html with the results of the analysis, that you can inspect using your browser.

** Building and running Docker image

You can build the docker image with

#+begin_src shell
$ docker build -t codex -f devenv/Dockerfile.debian .
#+end_src
(replace with Dockerfile.alpine for the alpine version).

You can then run the docker image with
#+begin_src shell
$ docker run -it --rm --name codex_debian codex:debian
#+end_src

Additionally, one can use docker to build the binaries and them extract them out
of the docker image (using =docker copy=) and use them locally.

* Structure of the source code

We describe the structure of the library top-down:
