(** A monad taking a string as an input, with autocompletion.
    - [title] is the monad title;
    
    - [suggestions] is a function that, given the current input
      string, returns a sorted list of suggestions (whose length should
      be smaller than [max]). No auto-completion is suggested when the
      list is empty. *)
