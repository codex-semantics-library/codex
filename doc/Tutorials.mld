We have written a few tutorials to show how codex can be used and extended.

{1 Quick start}

There is a short {{!page-"Quick start"}quick start} tutorial that shows the
steps needed to run Frama-C/codex on a simple C file. For a more in depth look
at the interface, check out the {{!page-"Types tutorial"}types tutorial}.

{1 Using Codex on a custom language}

The {{!page-"While tutorial"}while tutorial} describes how Codex's components can be used to build
an analyzer for a simple imperative [while] language. Along the way, it introduces
many of the core components of codex. It is mostly intended for developers who
want to use or extend the codex library.

{1:tt Analyzing C or binary using Codex types}

The {{!page-"Types tutorial"}types tutorial} presents Codex's refinement type system and how it
can be used to precisely specify memory layouts.
It was written to accompany the
{{: https://codex.top/papers/2024-oopsla-typedc-dependent-nominal-physical-type-system.html}OOPLSA 2024} paper.
It also describes the Frama-C/Codex
and Binsec/Codex interfaces (command line arguments, terminal and HTML outputs...).

It covers in particular:

- How to run the analysis on a C program, how to configure the C
  analysis, and how to inspect the results.
- How to run the analysis on a binary executable, how to configure
  the machine code analysis, and how to inspect the results.
- How to specify the types used in a C programs to refine the results
  of the analysis (which is generally a necessary step to obtain
  memory safety).

This one is more targeted to users wishing to use Codex to verify C or binary code.
