{- Download the latest binary release of Frama-C/Codex at {: https://github.com/codex-semantics-library/codex/releases/}}
{- Write a small C function in file [test.c]:
  {@c file=test.c[
int main(int i) { int x = i; if(i > 8) x = 8; return x; }
]}
  If GCC is not installed, use [test.i] instead of [test.c] ([.i] corresponds to already-preprocessed files).}
{- Launch the analysis and obtain a textual report of the analysis:
  {@bash[
  $ frama_c_codex -codex test.c -codex-exp-dump -main main
  [kernel] Parsing test.c (with preprocessing)
  [Codex_config] Setting pointer size to 64
  $ cat main.cdump
  test.c:1.26-27: `i' -> [--..--]
  test.c:1.32-37: `i > 8' -> {0; 1}
  test.c:1.32-33: `i' -> [--..--]
  test.c:1.53-54: `x' -> [-0x80000000..8]
  Unproved regular alarms:

  ]}
  If you are using Emacs' compilation-mode (probably works also in other editors),
  you can click on each expression, and they will bring you to the location in the file.}
{- Obtain an HTML report of the analysis:
   {@bash[
   $ frama_c_codex -codex test.c -main main -codex-html-dump
   ...
   ]}
   {%html:
   <iframe src="https://codex.top/assets/codexoutputs/quickstart_c.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="8" style="border:1px solid #000; border-radius:15px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);"></iframe>
   %}
   }
{- That's all to get started! As there are no reported alarms, your code is memory-safe,
   free from division-by-zero errors, and free from others errors that Codex checks.
   The most useful options are:
   - [-codex] launches Codex;
   - [-main] selects the entry point of the analysis;
   - [-codex-exp-dump] produces a textual dump of all expressions [funcname.cdump];
   - [-codex-html-dump] produces an HTML equivalent of the dump file;
   - [-codex-type-file file.typedc] uses TypedC specification, useful when
     analyzing functions independently, which is covered by the {{!page-"Types tutorial"}types tutorial}}
}

Happy verification!
