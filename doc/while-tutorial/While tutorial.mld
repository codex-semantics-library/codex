{0 Extending Codex to a simple while language}

We present a tutorial on a simple imperative [while] language, and demonstrates
how to statically analyze programs written in it using Codex, a modular abstract
interpretation library. This also serves as a nice introduction to various codex
components ({!Lattices}, {!Single_value_abstraction}, {!Domains}...). It is mostly
meant for developers who wish to use and extend Codex.
- {{!page-"While tutorial - chapter 1"}Chapter 1}: Contains the syntax which is defined with variables, arithmetic, boolean expressions, and control structures (e.g., [if] and [while]). It also provides a concrete interpreter for the [while] language;
- {{!page-"While tutorial - chapter 2"}Chapter 2}: Describes {!Lattices} and {!Single_value_abstraction} with simpler implementations;
- {{!page-"While tutorial - chapter 3"}Chapter 3}: Contains simple interval abstract domain which is then used to run the analysis on simple while programs;
- {{!page-"While tutorial - chapter 4"}Chapter 4}: Shows how one can use Codex building blocks to recreate the interval domain from chapter 3.
